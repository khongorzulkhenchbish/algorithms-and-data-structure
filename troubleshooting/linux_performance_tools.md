### Linux Performance tools lecture, Brendan Gregg, Part 1

### Problem Statement Method

1. What makes you **think** there is a performance problem?
2. Has this system **ever** performed well?
3. What has **changed** recently? (Software? Hardware? Load?)
4. Can the performance degradation be expressed in terms of **latency** or run time?
5. Does the problem affect **other** people or applications (or is it just you)?
6. What is the **environment**? Software, hardware, instance types? Versions? Configuration?
